# Instructions for UTA History graduate students, or anyone else.

This directory contains QGIS tutorials [John Garrigus](http://johngarrigus.com/gis) made in 2016, based on the GIS tutorials offered the [The Programming Historian. ](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons)

The Garrigus tutorials are here in GitHub so that experienced QGIS users can "clone" [GitHub term for "copy"] them, and make their own versions. 

For example, you might take the Barbados tutorial and remake it to feature Antigua. Someone else might feature Jamaica. 

When you choose a different location, you will re-write your version of the tutorial and you will need to find the underlying GIS data and historical maps that will be part of your tutorial. The last section of your tutorial should be a section entitled **Data Sources**. 

You can certainly hunt down your own geo-data -- there's lots of it on the web. Yours might be better than mine. However if you want to use the same websites where I got my data, that is fine.

I'll make a place in BlackBoard for you to upload those data files and images, so other members of our class can get to them.
